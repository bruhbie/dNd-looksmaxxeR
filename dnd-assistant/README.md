# Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) Assistant

A Clarkathon 2025 project by Barbie, Clay, and Michael! 

An assistant for Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), helping game masters access all of the tools they need from one place! A digital dice rolling feature, note-taking tool, a place to access stat blocks, music, and sound effects!

● Engineered a full-stack DM assistant application (JavaScript, Python/FastAPI, MongoDB) that cut
DM task-switching time by 75% by consolidating dice rolls, sound effects, and character
management into one cohesive interface.

● Developed a comprehensive character statblock module featuring 23 input fields and
base64 image uploads, enabling DMs to save and retrieve custom character sheets via a modal
interface.
